# Tests

I have opted to only implement E2E tests in the interest of time. Given a real project, I would like to see a mix unit, integration, and E2E.

Having a 'fake' data source would actually be really useful for fast and determinstic testing. I would revisit introducing a system to
use the in memory list of advocates from the seed directory for testing.
